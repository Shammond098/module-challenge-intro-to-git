Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a version control system. 
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Github is a website where developers place repositories for other developers to edit and review. Git is a version control system that keeps track of all changes made to files in a directory on my computer.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? The purpose of a pull request is to see the changes and compare the original repository with the edited branch on Github.com
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. The command you would use to switch branches would be command git checkout followed by branch name.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? Git fetch pulls updatesd from a remote branch from our local computer. It wont manipulate or destroy repository. Git pull command is a combination of git fetch and git merge. Git merge is a command that merges local repository with remote changes.
